# Contributing

Thanks for the interest. This project is deliberately kept in a state where it *can* be offered
under commercial terms later, so the contribution terms below matter a bit more than the size of the
project might suggest — please read them before sending code.

## Before a substantial PR — open an issue first

This is a solo project with a specific licensing posture. **Small, obvious fixes** (typos, clear bugs)
are welcome as direct PRs. For anything **substantial**, please open an issue to discuss first — it
saves you writing code that might not fit the direction, and keeps the licensing clean (below).

## Sign your commits (DCO)

Contributions are accepted under the **Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)** — by signing off, you
certify you wrote the change (or otherwise have the right to submit it). Add a sign-off to each commit:

```bash
git commit -s -m "your message"
```

That appends a `Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>` trailer (make sure your git `user.name`
and `user.email` are set). The full DCO 1.1 text is at the bottom of this file.

## Contribution licensing

The DCO on its own only certifies *provenance* — it does **not** grant the maintainer any right to
relicense. So, in addition to the DCO, by submitting a contribution you agree that:

1. Your contribution is licensed to the project and everyone downstream under the project's
   open-source license, **Apache-2.0**; **and**
2. You grant the maintainer a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license
   to also distribute your contribution, as part of the project, under **separate commercial terms**
   — i.e. the project may be offered under a dual (open-source + commercial) license in future.

In plain terms: **you keep your copyright**, your contribution stays Apache-2.0 for everyone, and the
maintainer can *also* include it if a commercially-licensed edition of the project ever exists. This
keeps that option open without asking you to assign anything away.

> This is the maintainer's stated contribution terms, not legal advice. If external contribution ever
> picks up, a formal CLA (e.g. via CLA Assistant) may replace this section.

## Running the tests

```bash
pip install -e . pytest
pytest -q
```

Keep the tests green; they're the spec. New behaviour should come with a test that would fail without it.
